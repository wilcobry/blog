<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span></p>et's be real, graphs are awesome, 
but in the world in which we live, interacting with data to customize information for our 
personal need is a necessity. In this post, we will take our Utah County housing data 
from the previous post, highlight the important insights, and transform our otherwise boring graphs into an interactive, 
user-friendly app that will allow a user to more effectively dive into their personalized data. 

## Investigating the Data
As we analyze the data from our house hunting webscraper, we need to remember our overall goal: 
easily find the available houses that meet our needs and are within budget. 
One of the best ways we can narrow down our search is by identifying the locations that are 
most likely to have houses in the desired price range. Taking a median of the house prices in every city within Utah
County, we see that there is a large range between the median prices throughout the cities.

## Creating an app


## Application Time!
The great thing about this app is it allows you to create your own personal data analysis! No matter what stage you are in the home-buying process, the features of this app will grant you an in-depth exploration of all that the housing market in Utah County has to offer. Try my housing data app for yourself and let me know in the comments what you think! Happy coding!
