<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span></p>et's be real, graphs are awesome, 
but in the world in which we live, interacting with data to customize information for our 
personal need is a necessity. In this post, we will take our Utah County housing data 
from the previous post, highlight the important insights, and transform our otherwise boring graphs into an interactive, 
user-friendly app that will allow a user to more effectively dive into their personalized data. 

## Investigating the Data
As we analyze the data from our house hunting webscraper, we need to remember our overall goal: 
easily find the available houses that meet our needs and are within budget. 
One of the best ways we can narrow down our search is by identifying the locations that are 
most likely to have houses in the desired price range. Taking a median of the house prices in every city within Utah
County, we see that there is a large range between the median prices throughout the varying locations. As new homebuyers, we can immediately eliminate the first 5 cities as overly "bujee" for our current needs. As such, our analysis has already helped hone us in on the best location for our house hunt.

This analysis on median home prices has been an effective tool as we pick which cities to focus our home searching. However, as a continued analysis would be beneficial for my specific needs, not everyone is looking for the same type of home, and therefore, they aren't looking for the same data. An app will allow us to personalize a house hunt for every single user.

## Creating an app
`Streamlit` is a powerful tool that allows us to interact with our data and customize visualizations to tailor an analysis to our specific needs. Building an app is then perfect for our overall goal of simplifying the home buying experience. This app will allow a user to specify their home requirements (city, budget, size) and immediately see updated visuals to understand the houses that are available for them!

## Housing App Overview
When designing my [housing app](https://househuntingapp.streamlit.app), I focused on what I, as a prospective homebuyer, would find useful to better narrow down my house search. 
1. **Certain cities are better suited to my needs**. After analyzing the median home prices for all the cities in Utah County, as a new home buyer, I can clearly tell that I should be focusing my home search in cities where the median home price is lower. Because of this, I created an input which allows users to specify the city where they will begin their search, followed by a histogram that displays the distribution of home prices for that city.

2. **We have a strict budget**. While looking at overpriced houses is a fun passtime, it doesn't get us closer to finding the right house. To make sure that the app focuses on houses the user can afford, I added a slider that allows the user to specify their desired price range. This input corresponds to a table with all the houses in this price range. Additionally, a histogram is displayed with the distribution of number of bedrooms available in this price range. 
3. **We don't need a big house**. After the user inputs their price range they will get a better idea of how many bedrooms they can get in their budget. Given my family's small budget and small size, we are looking for smaller houses. I created an input that allows a user to pick a desired number of rooms and a range of square footage. These inputs connect to a scatterplot that displays the square footage by price for the houses that meet these size constraints. As an example, I selected 2 beds, with a square footage range between 500 and 2000. The graph below reveals the houses meeting these requirements along with their price. Additionally, hovering over the point gives me detailed information about the house!

While looking for houses the old-fashioned way (on a website) can take hours of scrolling and clicking, this app allows a user to quickly and meaningfully personalize their home search. Within just a few minutes, a user can identify what and where and house in their budget would look like. 

## Application Time!
The great thing about this app is it allows you to create your own personal data analysis! No matter what stage you are in the home-buying process, the features of this app will grant you an in-depth exploration of all that the housing market in Utah County has to offer. Try my housing data app for yourself and let me know in the comments what you think!
